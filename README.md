# Web Clone – Front-End Only Project

Hello Coders!!

This is a basic front-end project where I’ve created a website clone using only **HTML and CSS**.

---

## 🔑 New Update

I’ve added a **Login Page with smooth transition effects** ✨

* Includes modern sliding panels
* Animated background gradients
* Clean and user-friendly design
* ✅ Uploaded all images (fully working online now)

---

## 🌍 Live Demo

👉 Check out the live site here: [My Website on GitHub Pages](https://rororonoa.github.io/SHOPTOPIA/)

---

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Copy the code and open it in your preferred IDE (**VS Code recommended**).
2. Check the structure carefully — I’ve added multiple images.
3. Most images are taken from the Amazon website (I’ll try to include them all soon).

## ⚠️ Attention

* This site is **not responsive** yet, so it may break on smaller screens.
* It’s a **static clone** — no real functionality like the original site.
* For better results, consider learning **Bootstrap** or watching tutorials on **YouTube**.

## 📖 About the Project

* This is my first attempt at a **clone website: Shoptopia.in**
* Now enhanced with a **Login Page + Transition Effects**
* Feel free to explore, learn, and modify it as you like.
