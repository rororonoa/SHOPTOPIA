# Web Clone – Front-End Only Project

Hello Coders!!

This is a basic front-end project where I’ve created a website clone using only **HTML** and **CSS**.

**How to Use:**

1. Copy the code and open it in your preferred IDE (VS Code is recommended).
2. Check the structure carefully — I’ve added multiple images.
3. Most images are taken from the Amazon website. I’ll try to include them all soon.

**Attention:**

   - This site is **not responsive**, so it may break on smaller screens.
   - It’s a **static clone** — no real functionality like the original site.
   - For better results, consider learning **Bootstrap** or watching tutorials on YouTube.

**About the Project:**

This is my **first attempt** at a clone website: **Shoptopia.in**
Feel free to explore, learn, and modify it as you like.

Thanks for checking it out — Happy Coding!
